Each file represents each project.
The first project is the file called "proj1-search-python3".
It focuses on the "search" part of the pacman algorithm the goal for the first project
was to be able to create different tree structures for the pac man to eat the food (dots).
The level of tree data structure was: reath first, depth first, A*, cost function and understanding the corners.

The second project is the file called "multiagent".
It focuses on the the ghost that follows the pacman.
We are able to learn from the worst alogrithms to the best possible ones.
The structures used in this project ranged from: minimax, alpha beta pruning, expectimax.

The thrid project is the file called "reinforcement".
It focused on letting the pacman learn it's mistakes and learn on it's own how to get the most points.
The main goal of this project was the learn reinforcement learning.
We used value iteration, Q-learning, greddy algorithm.

These projects made me understand how to use practical AI algorithms in real projects.
